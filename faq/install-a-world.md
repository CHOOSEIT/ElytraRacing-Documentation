# ‚ùì Install a world

{% hint style="info" %}
To install a world on a server we recommend to use multiverse-core [plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/multiverse-core.390/?\_\_cf\_chl\_tk=GmLfrVVBuHcX45YrvYZr4gU\_1nHpddVebab9TQNQ1IE-1662878209-0-gaNycGzNCL0)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
To have less issues installing the world you can open the world in your solo version of Minecraft to downgrade or upgrade to the version you want **(Be careful not every world can be downgraded or upgraded)**
{% endhint %}

**Next** you can simply put the folder of your world in your server's folder start your server and execute the command: **/mv import worldname normal** (you can teleport to your world using **/mv tp yourusername worldname**)&#x20;
