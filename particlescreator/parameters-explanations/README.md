First of all we have basics parameters like name, whether or not the particle is currently enable

{% hint style="info" %}
To see a particle in the particle selector in your games, the player has to have the permission: **elytraracing.particle.\<nameoftheparticle>**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Available particles:**

**Support coloration: REDSTONE**

**Others: Printed in the console at start**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Test your work:&#x20;

* Set **enable** to false
* set **name** as your ingame username

It will apply directly to you the particles after the **/erconfig reload**
{% endhint %}

### New Particle Association ! (showWith and removeFromPlayableSet)

**showWith** is a new parameter that allow you to display multiple particle at once (that way you are able to create particle that have multiple section for example and each has its own shape and color)&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Particle associated to a particle must be in the list of particle above the one you are working on and ENABLED !
{% endhint %}

**removeFromPlayableSet**  is a new parameter that allow you linked to **showWith** to create particle that won't be able to be played by players in game (Only by associating them with others)



{% hint style="danger" %}
Options of shape and color creator are separated by **;**
{% endhint %}

### **Key customisation**

There are 2 main parameters that we will explain here:

{% content-ref url="shapeparticle.md" %}
[shapeparticle.md](shapeparticle.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="colorcreator.md" %}
[colorcreator.md](colorcreator.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
